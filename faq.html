                        <p>No prior experience is necessary for our beginner classes and most workshops. We provide all the instruction, tools, and materials you need to create beautiful jewelry pieces.

                        <p>Care instructions depend on the materials used in your jewelry. Generally, we recommend storing pieces separately to prevent scratching, removing jewelry before swimming or showering, and cleaning with a soft cloth. Specific care instructions are provided with each piece purchased or created in our classes.</p>
